Branch is like different folder of initial branch, let say master branch. 
It's like parallel universe with the same files at point of creating a branch, and after it can change dramatically. 
It's kind of different version. Where you can try to implement new features or explore something else.
Branch can be merged with master if necessary to accumulate changes.
